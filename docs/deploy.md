# Manual install, upgrades and configuration

Most people should use the installer from the [README](../README.md#install). This page is for
manual installs, upgrades and the config file.

## Manual install (Hub)

```sh
# binaries from a release (or build them: make hub-static agent)
sudo install -m 755 moat-hub-linux-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/; s/aarch64/arm64/') /usr/local/bin/moat-hub
sudo moat-hub init --public-url https://moat.example.com --email you@example.com
sudo moat-hub install-service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now moat-hub
sudo moat-hub invite --email you@example.com          # open the link, create your passkey
sudo moat-hub recovery-codes --email you@example.com  # keep these off the server
```

Put the agent binaries (`moat-agent-linux-amd64`, `moat-agent-linux-arm64`, `SHA256SUMS`,
`VERSION`) in `/usr/local/share/moat/agent/` so that **Servers → Add server** can hand them to new
servers. `deploy/install-hub.sh <moat-hub binary> [init options]` does all of the above from a
source checkout.

The Hub listens on `127.0.0.1:8700` by default. Make one server the entry (Servers → Make entry)
so its agent serves the Hub and your apps on 80/443, or put your own reverse proxy in front.

## Upgrades

- **Hub:** replace `/usr/local/bin/moat-hub` and restart (`deploy/install-hub.sh` keeps the
  existing config). Database migrations run automatically; take a `moat-hub backup` first.
- **Agents:** update themselves when the Hub has a newer agent in
  `/usr/local/share/moat/agent/`.

## `/etc/moat/hub.json`

Created by `moat-hub init`; mode 600. The service reads it through systemd credentials.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `public_url` | Address users open (`https://moat.example.com`). Used for origin checks and links. |
| `cookie_domain` | Domain the sign-in cookie covers (default: parent of `public_url`). Apps must be under it. |
| `rp_id`, `rp_name` | WebAuthn relying party (default: `cookie_domain`, "Moat"). Changing `rp_id` invalidates passkeys. |
| `allowed_emails` | Accounts allowed to sign in (people you invite are added in the database). |
| `listen_address`, `listen_port` | Where the Hub listens (default `127.0.0.1:8700`). |
| `trusted_proxies` | Proxies whose `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted (default loopback). |
| `internal_url` | Address agents use to reach the Hub, if different from `public_url`. |
| `tunnel_url` | Address agents use for the entry tunnel, if the default doesn't fit. |
| `tailscale_auth` | `true` in Tailscale-only mode: trust `tailscale serve` identity headers from loopback. |
| `language` | Default alert language, `ko` or `en` (Settings → Alert language overrides it). |
| `privacy_contact` | Contact shown on the `/privacy` page (e.g. an email). Empty hides it. |
| `google.client_id`, `google.client_secret` | Optional Google sign-in (also settable in the web UI). |
| `telegram.bot_token`, `telegram.chat_id` | Telegram alerts (also settable in the web UI). |
| `database_path` | SQLite file (default `/var/lib/moat/hub.db`). |
| `session_idle_days`, `session_max_days` | Session lifetime (default 30 / 90). |
| `metrics_retention_days` | How long minute metrics are kept. |

## Using Moat login with your own nginx

If you keep nginx in front of some apps, protect them with Moat via `auth_request`. See
[`deploy/nginx/protect-snippet.conf`](../deploy/nginx/protect-snippet.conf): include it in a
`server` block, point `proxy_pass` of `/_moat_auth` at the Hub's `/auth/verify`, and add the Hub's
address to `trusted_proxies` if nginx runs on another machine. A `200` from `/auth/verify` means
signed in (the user is in the `X-Moat-User` response header); `401` means redirect to
`https://moat.example.com/login?rd=<original URL>`.
